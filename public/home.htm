<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
  I'm Wayne, a Software Developer and DevSecOps Engineer who has been writing
  software programs for 16+ years.  I made this site (and associated Easter Eggs)
  to have a proper Web 1.0 presence alongside my main site
  <a href="https://racer159.com">racer159.com</a>
  for all the poor people (like me) stuck on Windows 95 OSR 2 and Internet
  Explorer 5.0.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to take a look around, and if you find anything wrong with this site
  please email me at <a href="mailto:me@racer159.com">me@racer159.com</a>, since,
  in the spirit of geocities, this site is always "under construction".
